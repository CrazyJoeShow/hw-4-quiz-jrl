This is a quiz being built with javascript

The assignment was to create a quiz that that displays the questions and answers and takes user input.
There is a timer and a score multiplier as a bonus, so the quicker the better.

After much review and consulting pod2 , and reading A TON of documentation to try and utilize some of the tools I've learned and attempt to build this quiz.

-My first step was the index.html,quiz.js,quiz.css for the quiz page.
-Then using static HTML with hidden elements depending on current state of the game.
-I used Global variables to target and add content onto and apply values later.
-The quiz uses an array of objecs that are accessed for displaying content and if and else statements on the buttons that correspond to the correct answer.
-Timer responsive to wrong answers as well as counting down and stopping at 0.
